# Python Project: Predicting the stringency of government measures against coronavirus using Reddit data

This project is an assignment I did in a group with a classmate for my "Data science for economics" class during my MSc in Economics at Tilburg University, which obtained a grade of 10/10.
The code is available in a Jupyter notebook.

If I had to do it again, I would re-do the machine learning section, as I believe there are more appropriate models for text analysis. I would also change the research question to focus more on sentiment analysis than predicting the stringency of restrictions.
